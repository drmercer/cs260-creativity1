			<p>
				CS-260 is a web programming course offered at Brigham Young University. In order to encourage students to apply the skills they are learning, we will be holding our first ever hackathon for this course. Students may feel free to be creative with their projects and show off their skills to the class &mdash; as well as the professor, Mark Clement.
